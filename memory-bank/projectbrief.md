# Project Brief

This project appears to be a web application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The presence of `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts` suggests a modern frontend development setup. The `src` directory contains the main application logic, including components like `App.tsx` and `ExpertDetail.tsx`. The `public` directory contains static assets like images and logos.

The goal of this project is likely to build a user-facing application that displays information about experts, potentially for a directory or a similar service.
